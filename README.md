# Autonomous Drone Racing with MPC Control

A high-performance Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for autonomous drone racing through dynamic gate sequences. This system implements sophisticated trajectory planning and control that can adapt to moving gates in real-time while optimizing flight performance.

## üöÅ Core Functionality

The system combines several advanced control techniques:

- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: Uses ACADOS for fast optimization with attitude control interface
- **Dynamic Trajectory Planning**: Real-time replanning when gates move or are updated
- **Collision Avoidance**: Ellipsoidal constraints for gates and cylindrical constraints for obstacles
- **Adaptive Flight Modes**: Different speed profiles and approach strategies for each gate
- **Momentum Preservation**: Smooth trajectory transitions that avoid abrupt direction changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
### Setup

Follow the getting started guide: https://lsy-drone-racing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/setup.html

### Acados
Summary of installation:
```bash
# Clone the repo and check out the correct branch, initialize submodules.
cd ~/repos
git clone https://github.com/acados/acados.git
cd acados
git checkout tags/v0.5.0
git submodule update --recursive --init

# Build the application
# Note: If you use Robostack, this might lead to issues. Try to build acados outside your environment if this is the case.
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DACADOS_WITH_QPOASES=ON ..
# add more optional arguments e.g. -DACADOS_WITH_DAQP=ON, a list of CMake options is provided below
make install -j4

# In your environment, make sure you install the acados python interface:
# Note: If you build acados outside your environment previously, activate it again before executing the following commands.
cd ~/repos/acados
pip install -e interfaces/acados_template

# Make sure acados can be found by adding its location to the path. For robostack and micromamba, this would be:
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"$HOME/repos/acados/lib"' > ~/micromamba/envs/ros_env/etc/conda/activate.d/xcustom_acados_ld_library.sh
echo 'export ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR="$HOME/repos/acados"' > ~/micromamba/envs/ros_env/etc/conda/activate.d/xcustom_acados_source.sh


# Deactivate and activate your env again such that the previous two lines can take effect.
micromamba deactivate 
micromamba activate ros_env
# Run a simple example from the acados example to make sure it works.
# If he asks you whether you want to get the t_renderer package installed automatically, press yes.

```

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Adaptive Replanning
The system monitors gate positions and automatically replans trajectories when gates move beyond the threshold:

- **Movement Detection**: Compares observed vs. configured gate positions every 10 ticks
- **Approach Detection**: Only replans when drone is approaching the moved gate (prevents unnecessary replanning)
- **Smooth Transitions**: Preserves forward momentum to avoid abrupt direction changes
- **Weight Adjustment**: Temporarily increases path-following weights during replanning phase

### Dynamic Weight Management
The MPC cost function weights adapt based on flight conditions:

```python
# Weight adjustment phases
weight_adjustment_duration = 0.7 * freq  # Duration of enhanced weights (seconds * frequency)

# Gradual transition between weight sets during replanning
def _update_weights(self):
    if self.weights_adjusted:
        ticks_since_start = self._tick - self.weight_adjustment_start_tick
        if ticks_since_start < self.weight_adjustment_duration:
            self.mpc_weights = self.replanning_mpc_weights.copy()  # Enhanced tracking
        else:
            self.mpc_weights = self.original_mpc_weights.copy()    # Return to normal
            self.weights_adjusted = False
```

### Racing Line Optimization
The trajectory planner implements racing line techniques:

- **Gate Center Shifts**: Shifts gate crossing points forward for optimal racing lines
- **Speed Profiles**: Different speeds for approach (1.5 m/s), gate passage (1.5 m/s), and exit phases (2.2 m/s)
- **Momentum Preservation**: Maintains forward momentum through turns using cubic spline velocity boundary conditions

## üìä Control Pipeline

1. **Initialization**: Load configuration, setup MPC solver, initialize trajectory planner and collision avoidance
2. **Gate Progress Tracking**: Monitor current target gate and gates passed
3. **Replanning Check**: Every 10 ticks, check if gates have moved beyond 0.05m threshold
4. **Weight Update**: Adjust MPC weights based on replanning status
5. **Collision Parameter Update**: Update ellipsoid and cylinder constraints with current positions
6. **MPC Optimization**: Solve for optimal control inputs over prediction horizon
7. **Control Output**: Return attitude commands [thrust, roll, pitch, yaw]
8. **Logging**: Record performance metrics and flight data
